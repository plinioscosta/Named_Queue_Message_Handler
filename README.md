# Named_Queue_Message_Handler
It's modification of the well known LabVIEW template Queue Message Handler. QMH template is a wonderful starting point for an application where its multiple processes are contained within a single calling VI, whether explicit processes or subVI processes. Whem the application demands multiple independent modules, for example an software that has multiple dialog windows, configuration/options windows or other modal or not modal tools, managing those different and necessary queue for those VIs becomes a not so easy task.
